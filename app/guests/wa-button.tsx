We're doing the thing! Ekky & Didut are finally making it official (yes, there will be love, laughter, tears of joy and awkward dancing!). üíç We will say yes to forever on Saturday, 7 June 2025 in Jakarta.

We're inviting you to join us for a day full of happiness in celebrating our vows to the "I do", and raise a toast to forever. 

It's going to be an intimate event, to mind the limited capacity of the venue and to help us make necessary arrangements here & there, we kindly request you to RSVP the latest by 2 June 2025 by clicking on the link below:

Your presence would mean the world to us. We really hope you can make it and share our special day together.

Thank you and see you soon!

Best regards,
Ekky & Didut
